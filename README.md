Geodemographic classification based on 2016 Census data, with RShiny Dashboard to visualise the results.

This is a reproduction of a study carried out by the NCG (National Centre for Geocomputation) in Maynooth University who published an open-source method of creating a geodemographic classification based on the 2011 Census data.

Their study and the associated code (which I replicate) is availble on RPubs - https://rpubs.com/chrisbrunsdon/14998.

The paper which was published is titled 'An Open Source Geodemographic Classification of Small Areas in the Republic of Ireland' by 
Christopher Brunsdon & Martin Charlton & Janette E. Rigby.


To visualise the results, I built an RShiny dashboard https://billy-archbold.shinyapps.io/Geodemographic_Classification/.

This is an adapted verison of a fantastic RShiny dashboard created by Kyle Walker (http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/) who kindly shared the source code for the build on his application https://walkerke.shinyapps.io/neighborhood_diversity/.
